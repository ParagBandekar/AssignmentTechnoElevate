Network Protocol Driver in JDBC
The Network Protocol driver uses middle-ware (application server) that converts JDBC calls directly or indirectly into the vendor-specific database protocol. It is fully written in java..

Advantage of Network Protocol driver
No client side library is required because of application server that can perform many tasks like auditing, load balancing, logging etc.
This driver is both database and platform independent driver

Disadvantage of Network Protocol driver
Network support is required on client machine.
Requires database-specific coding to be done in the middle tier.
Maintenance of Network Protocol driver becomes costly because it requires database-specific coding to be done in the middle tier.
