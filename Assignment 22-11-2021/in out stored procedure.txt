IN parameters
IN is the default mode. When you define an IN parameter in a stored procedure, the calling program has to pass an argument to the stored procedure.

In addition, the value of an IN parameter is protected. It means that even you change the value of the IN parameter inside the stored procedure, its original value is unchanged after the stored procedure ends. In other words, the stored procedure only works on the copy of the IN parameter.

OUT parameters
The value of an OUT parameter can be changed inside the stored procedure and its new value is passed back to the calling program.

Notice that the stored procedure cannot access the initial value of the OUT parameter when it starts.

INOUT parameters
An INOUT  parameter is a combination of IN and OUT parameters. It means that the calling program may pass the argument, and the stored procedure can modify the INOUT parameter, and pass the new value back to the calling program.
